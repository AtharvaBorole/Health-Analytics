🧠 OCD Health Analytics Dashboard – Power BI & Excel
This project is a comprehensive data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) dashboard built using Power BI and Excel, focused on understanding patterns in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) diagnoses. The project involves slicing, filtering, and breaking down patient data across key attributes like gender, ethnicity, compulsion type, and obsession scores.

🔍 Objective:
To analyze OCD diagnosis trends over time and identify insights about how different demographics and behavior types relate to the condition. This project aims to support healthcare analysts, researchers, or stakeholders in making informed decisions using data visualization.

📊 Tools Used:
Power BI: For interactive data visualization

Microsoft Excel: For replicating the dashboard and performing parallel analysis

SQL (in the ideation process): Considered for more advanced slicing and monthly grouping

📈 Key Features:
🔹 Time Series Analysis:
Line chart showing the number of OCD diagnoses month-over-month.

Notable spikes were observed towards the end of years like 2017 and 2018, which led to deeper curiosity about possible external or seasonal factors.

🔹 Gender Distribution:
A donut chart showing male vs. female diagnoses.

The creator expressed interest in doing a month-over-month gender breakdown for future versions.

🔹 Ethnicity Breakdown:
A horizontal bar chart showing how diagnoses are distributed across ethnic groups (Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, African).

Caucasian individuals had the highest representation in the dataset.

🔹 Compulsion Type Analysis:
A bar chart displaying frequency of different compulsion behaviors (e.g., washing, checking, praying).

"Washing" emerged as the most common compulsion type.

🔹 Obsession Type & Score:
A visual comparing obsession types (e.g., contamination, symmetry) against patient counts.

Another visual compared average obsession scores, which were relatively close across types.

📁 Excel Dashboard Replication:
The entire Power BI dashboard was replicated using Microsoft Excel, featuring similar visuals.

Gridlines were removed for a cleaner look, and charts were arranged in a logical layout.

Visuals include: Line charts, bar charts, and a pie chart — all showing the same insights.

💡 Lessons & Reflections:
The project highlights the importance of sticking to scope in data analysis.

Even though many interesting investigative paths (e.g., gender trends by month) emerged, the focus remained on delivering a clear, complete analysis at a specific point in time.

This was the creator’s second Power BI project, and it built upon lessons learned from the first, which gained significant traction (10K+ views on YouTube).

🧩 Future Improvements:
Implement a slicer for dynamic filtering (e.g., by year or gender).

Include monthly breakdowns by gender or other attributes using SQL preprocessing.

Further polish the Excel visuals and possibly embed interactivity using VBA or PivotCharts.

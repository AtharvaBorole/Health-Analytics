🧠 OCD Health Analytics Dashboard | Power BI & Excel
  A data-driven mental health analytics project that leverages the power of Power BI and Excel to visualize, analyze, and uncover trends in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder     
  (OCD) diagnoses. This dashboard provides actionable insights into how OCD manifests across different genders, ethnicities, and behavioral types—turning raw clinical data   
  into an intuitive, decision-support tool for healthcare professionals and researchers.

🚀 Why This Project Matters:
  With rising global awareness around mental health, understanding conditions like OCD through data storytelling is more important than ever. This project translates complex   health records into clear visual patterns, enabling faster analysis and better-informed conversations in mental health policy and care.

💡 Highlights & Achievements:
  Trend Analysis with Time Series Visualization
  Diagnosed cases were tracked month-over-month, revealing seasonal spikes—especially at the end of years like 2017 and 2018—raising questions about environmental or         
  psychological triggers.

Demographic Breakdown

  Gender Distribution: Clear visualization of diagnosis rates across genders using dynamic donut charts.

  Ethnicity Insights: A bar chart revealing significantly higher diagnoses among Caucasians compared to other groups.

  Behavioral Patterns in OCD
